## LLM System Design

Overview

This repository contains the design documents and architecture for a Large Language Model (LLM) system. The LLM is a deep learning model that generates human-like text and is trained on a massive dataset of text. <br/>

## System Components 
Data Ingestion: Handles data loading, preprocessing, and storage.
Model Training: Responsible for training the LLM using the ingested data.
Model Serving: Handles API requests and generates text using the trained model.
Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the LLM using various metrics.

## System Architecture
Data Flow: Data is ingested from various sources, preprocessed, and stored in a database. The model training component reads data from the database, trains the model, and stores the model artifacts. The model serving component uses the trained model to generate text.

## Technology Stack
Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, HuggingFace Space.
